Drift-Diffusion Basic Semiconductor Equations for Diode simulation.

The main task for this project is to implement simple simulator tool
for basic semiconductor equations in drift-diffusion approximation.

For example simulator tool could be used for diod junction
current-voltage curve evaluation.
